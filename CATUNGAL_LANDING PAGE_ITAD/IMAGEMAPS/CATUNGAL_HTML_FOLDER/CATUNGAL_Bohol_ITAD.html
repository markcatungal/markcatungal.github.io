	<p>Chocolate Hills is the most famous Bohol tourist destination. There are more than 1,000 symmetrical mounds, conical and dome-shaped that most people liken them to Hershey’s Kisses. It is called the Chocolate Hills not because it’s made of chocolate but because of its color.</p>
	
	<h1>Discussion of the place </h1>
	<p>Bohol is a province of the Philippines, in the country’s Central Visayas region. It comprises Bohol Island and numerous smaller surrounding islands. Bohol is known for coral reefs and unusual geological formations, notably the Chocolate Hills. On the main island, near the town of Carmen, these 1,200 or so symmetrical mounds turn cocoa-brown in the dry season, contrasting with the surrounding jungle's greenery.</p>
	
	<h1>How to Get to Bohol</h1>
	<p>Bohol is the prime tourist destination for local and foreign travelers. It is accessible from major cities of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.  Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao are the primary island groups of the Philippine archipelago.

	Major jump-offs in Luzon include the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, and Clark International Airport in Angeles City, Pampanga. On the other hand, Davao International Airport in Davao City is the primary jump-off in Mindanao.

	Aside from air travel, you also have the option to travel by sea. You can reach Bohol via fast craft from Cebu, Dumaguete, Siquijor, and Camiguin.</p>
	
	<h2>By Flights</h2>
	<p>The Bohol-Panglao International Airport services the whole Bohol Province. This airport opened last November 2018. It replaced the old airport that used to be in Tagbilaran City, the capital of Bohol Province.

	Bohol-Panglao Airport is dubbed as the “Green Gateway to the World” and the first “Eco-airport in the Philippines” because of its environment-friendly equipment and facilities.

	Hence, you might want to book your accommodations in Panglao island itself or start your Bohol adventure in the tourist spots in Panglao for your convenience. If you booked a hotel in Tagbilaran, there is a regular air-conditioned bus from the airport to Island City Mall in Tagbilaran City.

	At the moment, Bohol is only connected to domestic destinations. If you are coming from outside of the Philippines, you will have to fly to Luzon or Mindanao to catch a plane to Bohol.</p>

	<h2>From Luzon or Mindanao in the Philippines to Bohol</h2>

	<p>Traveling by air is the most convenient and hassle-free way to reach Bohol. If you’re coming from Luzon, you can fly directly from Ninoy Aquino International Airport  (NAIA) in Manila to the Bohol-Panglao International Airport.

	It will take you approximately an hour and a half. Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, and Air Asia have daily flights from Manila to Bohol.

	Another Luzon jump-off option you have is to travel from Clark International Airport in Angeles City. The trip will take about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific have daily flights from Pampanga to Bohol.

	If you're in Mindanao, you can fly to Bohol directly from the Davao International Airport. It will take just about an hour. Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, and Air Asia have daily flights from Davao to Bohol. 

	Aside from going to Bohol from Luzon and Mindanao, you can also opt to fly to Cebu first and explore the Queen City of the South's tourist spots. From there, you can hop on a fast-craft to Bohol at the Cebu Port which will be discussed below.</p>

	<h2>From Outside of the Philippines to Bohol</h2> 

	<p>As mentioned, Bohol is currently only connected to domestic destinations. If you’re coming from outside of the Philippines, you will have to fly to Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Airport.

	NAIA is connected to several international destinations in North East and Southeast Asia, Middle East, Oceania, North America, and Europe. From the Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport, you can fly directly to the New Bohol International Airport in Panglao Island, Bohol.</p>

	<h2>By Ferry</h2>
	<p>Another way to reach Bohol is by traveling by sea. While this route may take longer, you will get to experience a different kind of adventure. Several ferries can take you to Bohol from Cebu, Dumaguete, Siquijor, Cagayan de Oro, and Camiguin. 

	OceanJet, Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, and Super Shuttle Ferry are the leading ferry companies that travel to Bohol from various locations in Visayas and Mindanao.

	OceanJet has daily trips to Bohol from Cebu, Dumaguete, and Siquijor. Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, Cokaliong Shipping Lines, and Lite Ferries have weekly trips to Bohol from Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao. Super Shuttle Ferry also has daily trips from  Camiguin to Bohol.</p>

	<h2>From Cebu by Ferry</h2>

	<p>If you’ll be coming from Cebu, the fastest way to reach Bohol is via fast craft. You will reach Tagbilaran Port after two hours. OceanJet has several trips from Bohol to Cebu every day. 

	You can also take the slow ferry to get to Tagbilaran. Lite Ferries have daily trips to Tagbilaran. While a slow ferry is cheaper than the fast craft, it will take you four hours to reach Bohol.

	There are five major passenger ports in Cebu; Pier 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Take note that OceanJet and Lite Ferries operate at Pier 1. You can purchase your tickets at the ferry terminal, but it is more advisable to buy them in advance.</p>
