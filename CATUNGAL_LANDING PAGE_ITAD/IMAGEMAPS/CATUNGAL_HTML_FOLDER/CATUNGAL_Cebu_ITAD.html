	<p>Going south, you could climb the Osmeña Peak of Cebu in Mantalongon, Dalaguete (pronounced “Dalaget”). Standing at 1,013 meters above sea level, Osmeña Peak is the highest point in the entire island.  Lime stones that have sharp protruding peaks which are perfect for taking pictures make up these hills. The peak is part of the Mantalongon mountain range that stretches as far as the municipality of Badian. It is considered a twin to Bohol’s Chocolate Hills.Further, the main activities here are hiking and camping. Most hikers prefer two hiking trails. The first one begins in Badian, passing by Kawasan Falls.On the other hand, the other one is in the town of Dumanjug, which culminates in Brgy Liong. In addition, when you trek going to the top of the mountain, don’t forget to bring your water, it will help you re-hydrate.</p>
	
	<h1>Discussion of the place </h1>
	<p>When it comes to tourist spots in the Philippines, nothing is as diverse as Cebu, the Queen City of the South, and the oldest city in the country. Outside of Luzon, it's one of the highly urbanized cities in the country next to the capital Manila. It's also where Mactan-Cebu International Airport is located, making it accessible not just to domestic travelers but to foreignerers as well. Cebu is a province of the Philippines, in the country’s Central Visayas region, comprising Cebu Island and more than 150 smaller surrounding islands and islets. Its prosperous port capital, Cebu City, retains landmarks from its 16th-century Spanish colonial past, including the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño church and triangular Fort San Pedro. Tops, an observation deck on Mt. Busay, has sweeping views over the city. The name Cebu refers both to the island province and to Cebu City. While most cultural and historic attractions are found in the capital, the best-known tourist spots in Cebu can be found all over the island.</p>
