	<p>Come and visit Valugan Boulder Beach. Countless round boulders and smaller stones fill the entire three-kilometer stretch of this beach in Batan Island.

	It is said that the rocks on this beach were ejected from Mt. Iraya during an eruption several centuries ago and that the stones have been rounded due to the years of continually pounding waves from the Pacific Ocean. Because of the rough terrain, swimming at Valugan Boulder Beach is not allowed. Taking the stones home as souvenirs is not allowed either.It’s best visited during the early morning or late afternoon!Make sure to catch the sunrise if you can as it’s a beautiful sight to behold.It’s one of the must-see tourist spots in the province. Often a part of North Batan tours, you can visit this beach by riding a tricycle or renting a van from the Basco Airport or town proper.Although the tourist spot has strong winds and powerful waves hitting the boulders, Valugan Boulder Beach is a beautiful tourist spot included in a sightseeing trip in North and South Batan.</p>
	
	<h1>Discussion of the place </h1>
	<p>Batanes is an archipelagic province in the Philippines, administratively part of the Cagayan Valley region. It is the northernmost province in the country, and also the smallest, both in population and land area. Its capital is Basco located on the island of Batan. Batanes in the Philippines has a little bit of everything for different types of travelers: the mountains, the sea, the rolling hills, and the food. But above all, Batanes offers a unique type of refuge — peace and quiet, and the taste of a back-to-basics lifestyle. Batanes, called the Home of the Winds, is considered the smallest province in the Philippines with only 230 kilometers of total land area. Part of Batanes’ charm comes from its somewhat seclusion from its busier and more crowded neighboring provinces. As the northernmost province in the country, its distance, size, and small population help preserve the unspoiled beauty of the place and the peaceful lifestyle of its people. A trip to Batanes is a welcome escape from the hustle and bustle of city living.</p>
