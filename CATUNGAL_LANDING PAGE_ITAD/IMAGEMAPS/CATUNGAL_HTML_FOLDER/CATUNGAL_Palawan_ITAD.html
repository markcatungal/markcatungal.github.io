	<p>Less than an hour’s drive from the Puerto Princesa City center lies another globally recognized natural attraction. The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, also commonly known as the Puerto Princesa Underground River, was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders of Naturein 2012. This gave tourists a good reason to stay a while in the province’s capital, instead of beelining northwards to El Nido or Coron. Here, visitors enter a cave aboard paddle boats directed by their personal guide. And inside they are treated to an astonishing display of stalactites and stalagmites suspended above the calm river.</p>
