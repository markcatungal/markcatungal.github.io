	<p>Also known as “back beach”, Bulabog is a popular venue for high-altitude activities such as windsurfing and kitesurfing. In fact, there are competitions held in this Boracay tourist spot Visayas. Even if you’re not familiar with the sport, watching the surfers and their acrobatic moves can be very entertaining.
	<br> <br>
	So if you want to get a panoramic view of the island, make sure to visit Bulabog Beach!</p>
	
	<h1>Discussion of the place </h1>
	<p>Boracay is a small island in the central Philippines. It's known for its resorts and beaches. Along the west coast, White Beach is backed by palm trees, bars and restaurants. Boracay Island, one of the top beaches in the Philippines, is blessed with a long stretch of powdery white sand beach (called White Beach), crystal clear and azure waters, a stunning sunset, and more. The island doesn’t fall short on adventures and activities for people of all ages.</p>

	<h1>How to Get to Boracay</h1> 
	<p>Boracay is accessible from the major cities of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao – three primary island groups of the Philippine archipelago.  

	Before traveling to Boracay, make sure you have a printed voucher from your pre-booked accredited Boracay resorts and hotels. You will be denied entry to the island if you don’t hold a voucher from your resort or hotel. It is part of the new rules that the local government and tourism office is implementing since Boracay opened to the public after the rehabilitation program in 2018.</p>

	<h2>Going to Caticlan Jetty Port</h2> 

	<p>The main jump-off point is Caticlan Jetty Port, but there are different ways to get there. Here are four transport options when traveling to Caticlan Jetty Port:</p>

	<h2>By Air</h2>
	<p>It is the fastest route when going to Boracay. It is also the most accessible since flights are coming from different parts of the Philippines and even several countries outside the Philippines.

	If you’re coming from Manila, the capital of the Philippines located in Luzon, take a 1-hour domestic flight from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport to Caticlan. Flying in from Clark to Boracay via Caticlan is also an option if you’re coming from the Northern part of Luzon or if you want to avoid the traffic in Manila. Airfares from Clark are usually lower than Manila.

	If you’re coming from the Visayas, there are direct flights to Caticlan from Cebu City’s Mactan International Airport. If you’re coming from Mindanao, there are direct flights from Davao Francisco Bangoy International Airport to Caticlan. From Caticlan Airport, take a 10-15 minute tricycle ride going to Caticlan Jetty Port. <p>

	<h2>By Ferry</h2> 
	<p>Most locals ride a ferry going to Boracay as it's much cheaper. If you don't mind traveling for long hours or a couple of days, then you might try this mode of transportation. Take note that the main port for Boracay is Caticlan Jetty Port. Below are some of the best ways to go to this port to the island.</p>

	<h2>By Direct RoRo Vessel</h2> 
	<p>If you would like to take the more scenic but much longer trip to Boracay, you can ride the Roll On, Roll Off (RoRo). RoRo ships are vessels that are designed to carry wheeled vehicles.</p> 

	<h2>By Bus from Manila and Board a RoRo</h2>
	<p>Several bus companies are maintaining the Manila-Caticlan route. You can hop on a bus from either the Cubao or Pasay terminal. Your total travel time for this route is approximately 13 hours, excluding the boarding time between trips.

	Cubao/Pasay to Batangas Pier (2 hours)

	RoRo trip from Batangas Pier to Calapan, Mindoro (2 to 3 hours)

	Land travel from Calapan to Roxas Port, Mindoro (2 to 3 hours)

	RoRo trip from Roxas Port to Caticlan Jetty Port (4 to 5 hours) </p>

	<h2>By Private Car from Manila and Board a RoRo</h2> 
	<p>You can also take the RoRo route using your own or hired car. It can be a good option when traveling in a big group or with your family and if you don’t mind the long travel hours. The same bus route will apply, except that you will drive to the Batangas Pier and you must book your RoRo tickets on your own when you get there.

	Additionally, you can’t charter your vehicle into Boracay Island, so you need to leave your car at the Caticlan Jetty Port for a parking fee per night. Depending on the size of your vehicle, this may cost you a lot. You also need to pay for the passenger fee and terminal fee during vessel transfers.</p>
