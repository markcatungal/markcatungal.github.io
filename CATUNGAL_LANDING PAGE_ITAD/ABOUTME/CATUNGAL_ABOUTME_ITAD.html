I am Mark Angelo Catungal from Marikina City. <sup>1</sup> <b><q>Childhood is the most fun and memorable time in anyone’s life.</q></b> <sup>2</sup> It is the first stage of my life which we enjoy in whatever way we like. <sup>3</sup> Besides, this is the time that shapes up our future. <sup>4</sup> The memories of my childhood ultimately become the lifelong memory which always brings a smile on my face. <sup>5</sup> As we grow, we feel more attachment to our childhood, and we want to have a memory lane on that period. <sup>6</sup> Everyone has a few memories from their childhood that seem so vividly true that we cling onto them and believe that every single little detail of this memory is completely true. <sup>7</sup> Growing up, I had a very loving family. Since I am the second to the eldest it is just my brother who I used to play every day. <sup>8</sup> One day when I was 3 or 4 years old, we have a yearly vacation on my father’s province. <sup>9</sup> Every year we always went to Bonoan Beach in Pangasinan for our swimming bonding with cousins’ uncles, aunties, and my grandmother. <sup>10</sup> Because I was young, I enjoyed playing in sand and making a hole and sometimes a little castle. <sup>11</sup> I enjoyed playing that I forgot which cottage we rented because all the cottages look just the same. <sup>12</sup>  I keep on walking and cried hard because I cannot find our cottage. <sup>13</sup>  I thought I cannot find my family but fortunately 3  native teenagers asked and accompanied me to look for our cottage and my  parents. <sup>14</sup> After some time, they finally found my father who at that time also keep on looking. <sup>15</sup> He immediately approached the 3 boys and Thank them.<sup>16</sup>I will not be forgot that experience because I am still that young, but I experienced that nerve shocking experiences.<sup>17</sup>  On this time also when I experienced stepping on a rusted nail that resulted for my jaw locking.<sup>18</sup> My mom and dad brought me to Barangay Sta Elena so that I will be treated and vaccinated by anti-tetanus. <sup>19</sup> They found a doctor but there is no available medicine. <sup>20</sup> He went to many branches of Mercury drug it is out of stack. <sup>21</sup>  My mother told my dad to go back to Barangay Parang and had my anti tetanus shot at Parang Health Center. <sup>22</sup> There, I was shot by an anti-tetanus and was given a medicine that I will take for 2 days. <sup>23</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

<b><q>The teenage years are the best years of my life.</q></b>	<sup>1</sup>It is the beautiful period of our lives, when we begin to bloom as people and really find our sense of self in a society.<sup>2</sup> Teenagers are generally full of vitality and energy.<sup>3</sup>This advantage allows them to conquer the world literally, experience new insights, gain wisdom and acquire knowledge.<sup>4</sup>In our teenage years we started to go out of comfort zones.<sup>5</sup> As teenagers we take risks, try out new things that might not be the best decisions and begin to talk back to our parents, but besides all of the drawbacks that come with adolescence, there are lots of bright perks of being a teenager.<sup>6</sup> When I am in high school, I start to realize, that we were no longer the oldest grade in school anymore.<sup>7</sup> I was lost in a new building, surrounded by new people, new peers, new teachers, new principal.<sup>8</sup>Everything is new.<sup>9</sup> Looking around at the older grades, I notice that some of them are vain . They now act as young lady and gentlemen and knew how to took care of themselves. They learned to dress up and talked with sense.<sup>10</sup> The older grades, look much older than their age.<sup>11</sup> They already figured out how to do their fashion styles, they are now in a relationships, The young ladies knew how to do their makeup, so even if they have pimples, they can covered it expertly.<sup>12</sup> Through high school, people change.<sup>13</sup> You will encountered bullies, and snobs , Some are friendly and more approachable.<sup>14</sup> There are teams, and groups to join, you make new friends in your new surroundings.<sup>15</sup> But I am lucky that I have a great a friends that until now we are still friends.<sup>16</sup> Me and my friends bond once a week by going to their house,our house  and play all day and it makes our friendship stronger.<sup>17</sup> We gained our parents trust and treated each other like a brothers.<sup>18</sup> My friends always motivated and cheered me.<sup>19</sup> They never leave me in bad times.<sup>20</sup>  Having a loving family and all is okay but you also need true friendship to be completely happy.<sup>21</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

 I thought college feels like I'm entering adulthood. <sup>1</sup> Attending college is a terrifying and overwhelming experience for me. <sup>2</sup> It is a case of when the fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all. <sup>3</sup> We do not know if we adjust to a place where every single student must stand on their own and take responsibility for my own actions, education and future.<sup>5</sup> Sadly, some college students believe that college is only about graduating and finding a suitable job. <sup>6</sup> I admit, I was one of those students. <sup>7</sup> But my college experience has helped me realize that college is about finding yourself of who I wanna be as a person and the type of person whom I want to become.<sup>8</sup> When I am in UE, I have no acquaintance. <sup >9</sup> So, basically its new for me. <sup>10</sup> I'm a shy person, so I find it difficult mingling with others and approaching someone during my first day. <sup>11</sup> But I believe Im not the only one who shares the same experience like i did. <sup>12</sup> So, I look around and observe who is in the same situation as I am. <sup>13</sup> I immediately approach the person whom I think graduated from other school and approach him. <sup>14</sup> As the time passed by, I did not just overcome my shyness I also learn how to communicate efficiently with others. <sup>15</sup> One thing that I like in college is that there are so many activities that students can engage in. <sup>16</sup> There are clubs and organization that I can blend in and showcase my abilities. <sup>17</sup> There are also events where we cheer for our beloved school I enjoy watching and cheering for them. <sup>18</sup> Its just only the beginning, thus I enjoyed my first-year experience in University of the East. <sup>19</sup> I also agree that <q><b>The college years are the best time in a person's life. </b></q><sup>20</sup> Hopefully we can go back in the university as soon as possible. <sup>21</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>
